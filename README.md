# Research-on-experts-features-and-ML-algoritms
This research is about influence of number of extracted features from audio-files and the quality of classification with the use of ML-algorithms

## Extracted features:
All the features were extracted with openSMILE: [openSMILE] (https://www.audeering.com/research/opensmile/)
The acoustic features that were used for the experiment are the following (in commas represented the number of features): GEMAPS(62), eGEMAPS(88), Interspeech 2009(384), Interspeech 2010(1582), Interspeech 2013(6373).

## The dataset:
The dataset that was used for the experimnent is Nonspeech7k: [Nonspeech7k] (https://zenodo.org/records/6967442). 
In the dataset were represented 7 classes of events: breath-1850, cough-702, cry-1996, laugh-1273, scream-663, sneeze-266, yawn-264.
